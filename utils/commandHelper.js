Salut! I'm the ${getAge(
  "02/07/2000"
)}-year-old software engineer bringing a taste of tech to the sunny landscapes of the south of France.
<br/><br/>
By day, I'm crafting digital solutions at <a href="https://www.zendesk.com" target="_blank">Zendesk</a>, but when the workday ends, you'll find me lacing up my running shoes, hopping on my bike, or hitting the trails for a hike.
<br/><br/>
They say programming is all about problem-solving, but let me tell you, debugging code is nothing compared to finding the perfect hiking trail with a view. So, whether you need help with a bug or just want to swap stories about the best cycling routes, I'm your guy â€“ just don't ask me to choose between my love for coding and my love for the great outdoors!
